        <h2>The best of two worlds</h2>
        <p>
         <code>ls</code> assumes two things about your library
          <ul>
            <li>1) Its source is opensource and hosted on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a></li>
            <li>2) You build your projects with <a href="https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki" target="_blank">sbt</a>*</li>
          </ul>
          * 2 is not required, but highly recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>ls</code> learns about your library through a process called <code>lsyncing</code>, which synchronizes <code>ls</code> with build information hosted on Github. Because only privileged parties may commit to these repositories, <code>ls</code> is not concerned with who is requesting an <code>lsync</code>—that is, authentication—but with the controlled project metadata on Github.
      </p>
      <h2 id="lsync-spec">lsync syncs library versions</h2>
      <p>
        So what are you actually publishing? Information.
        <code>ls</code> stores semi-structured information about each published version of your library's build in a json encoded file within your repository source tree. It is encouraged to only <code>lsync</code> build info about released versions.
      </p>
      <p>The following is a description of the format that <code>ls</code> uses to capture version snapshots of library information.
      <pre><code>{{
 <span class="comment"># a maven/ivy organization identifier</span>
 <span class="key">"organization"</span>:"org.yourdomain",

  ],
 <span class="comment"># is this an sbt plugin?</span>
 <span class="key">"sbt"</span>: false
}}</code></pre>

      <p>To perform an <code>lsync</code> for a given project, simply perform the following HTTP <code>POST</code></p>
      <pre><code>curl -X POST http://ls.implicit.ly/api/1/libraries 
  -F="<span class="key">user</span>=your-gh-user"
  -F="<span class="key">repo</span>=your-gh-repo"
  -F="<span class="key">version</span>=version-to-sync"</code></pre>
     This will tell <code>ls</code> to extract any files in the <code>github.com/your-gh-user/your-gh-repo</code> repository for files matching <code>src/main/ls/version-to-sync.json</code> and store the library's metadata.
      </p>
      <p>
        No wants you to hand copy that for every library you write. That's what plugins are for!
      </p>
      <h2>Say hello to ls-sbt</h2>
      <p>To install a convenient <code>ls</code> client, install the following <a href="https://github.com/n8han/conscript">conscript</a> locally</p>
      <pre><code>$ cs softprops/ls</code></pre>
      <p>Then in the root of your project run</p>
      <pre><code>$ lsinit</code></pre>
      <p>With the <code>ls-sbt</code> plugin installed to your project, you can generate version info automatically from its sbt build.</p>
      <p>A few customization settings you may want so set are</p>
      <pre><code>seq(lsSettings:_*)

(LsKeys.tags in LsKeys.lsync) := Seq("futures", "async-awesome")

(externalResolvers in LsKeys.lsync) := Seq(
  "my own resolver" at "http://repo.myhost.io")

(description in LsKeys.lsync) :=
  "One futures library to rule them all."
</code></pre>
      <p>You can easily generate the json file mentioned above with the following task.</p>
      <pre><code>sbt> ls-write-version</code></pre>
      <p>Add or edit the generated file under <code>src/main/ls/:version.json</code> to fit your liking before commiting to git and pushing to your Github remote.</p>
      <p>When you are ready to sync your library's build info with <code>ls</code>, do the following</p>
      <pre><code>sbt> lsync</code></pre>
      <p>That's it! Feel free to go ahead and start banging out the next awesome version of your library now.</p>
       <h2>A note on sbt plugins</h2>
      <p>Authors of sbt plugins may <code>lsync</code> their library information with <code>ls</code> for others to find their plugins but <code>ls-install</code> and <code>ls-try</code> do not currently support installing plugins. This will probably change soon.</p>

    <div id="finding">
      <h1><a href="#finding">Thumbing through</a></h1>
      <p>There are lot of scala libraries out there, waiting to make your life easier.</p>
      <p><code>ls</code> aims to make finding Scala libraries as simple as it possibly can be by adding some vocabulary to your sbt shell.</p>
      <p>To find a library by name use <code>ls -n</code></p>
      <pre><code>sbt> ls -n unfiltered</code></pre>
      <p>This command will find any ls-published library named <code>unfiltered</code>, listing recent versions with descriptions</p>
      <p>What if you are looking for a specific version? Just add <code>@version</code> to your query</p>
      <pre><code>sbt> ls -n unfiltered@0.5.1</code></pre>
      <p>What if you don't know the name of the library you are looking for? Try searcing by tags and see what pops up.</p>
      <pre><code>sbt> ls web netty</code></pre>
      <p>Tags help categorize libraries and make them easier for users to find.</p>
    </div>

 <div id="installing">
       <h1><a href="installing">Checking the fit</a></h1>
       <p>Once you find the library you are looking for, you have a few options. You can hand edit a configuration file, paste in the info you had to previous search for or you could do</p>
       <pre><code>sbt> ls-try unfiltered</code></pre>
       <p>This will temporarily add the latest version of unfiltered to your library dependency chain. Try typing <code>console-quick</code> to play with the library in the repl. If you don't like it, you can always remove it with the sbt built-in command <code>session clear</code> or by reloading your project. If you do find the library that fits you need, it's just as easy to install it.
       </p>
       <pre><code>sbt> ls-install unfiltered</code></pre>
       <p>The same syntax for specifying a specific version applies</p>
       <pre><code>sbt> ls-install unfiltered@0.5.1</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div id="uris">
      <h1><a href="#uris">You or I</a></h1>
      <p>Because of the open nature of Github, a forked repository easily can coexist with another of the same name under a different user's account. Libraries is <code>ls</code> are just references to <code>uris</code>. More specifically a uri for Github repository, a library name, and version.</p>
      <pre><code>sbt> ls -n library@0.5.0 user/repo</code></pre>
      <p>
        By default, <code>try</code> and <code>install</code> will always use the latest version of a library by name using an inferred uri.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not recommended to <code>lsync</code> version information across repos. Doing so may decrease the likelihood of your users finding the right version of the library. In the case a library author has lsync'd across repositories, ls will prompt you for the repo you wish to use.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="ls-issues">
      <h1><a href="#ls-issues">Issues</a></h1>
      <p><code>ls</code> makes a handful of assumptions about your libraries and build environments. It's quite possible some of these assumptions are flawed. If you find one, <a href="https://github.com/softprops/ls/issues" target="_blank">let me know</a>.</p>
